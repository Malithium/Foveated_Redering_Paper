\section{Introduction}
Modern computer systems and devices are capable of rendering photo-realistic imagery at resolutions as high as 4K, the computational cost to render these images is huge. The human eye is only capable of sensing fine detail within a 5\degree central circle, this visual field is called the fovea, the angular distance away from the fovea is called eccentricity, as eccentricity increases the fine detail we see in the fovea rapidly decreasses, we call this area the periphery. Foveated rendering takes into account the users gaze and renders the graphics based on this, reducing the level of detail in the periphery and rendering the finer detail within the field of the fovea, this results in dramatically reduced computational cost when rendering. In this report we will look at previous implementations of foveated rendering systems and how they have developed overtime.
