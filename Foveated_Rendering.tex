\begin{abstract}
Foveated Rendering is the process of rendering imagery based on the users gaze. The eye fixation region is rendered in a higher level of detail while the region outside it is rendered in less detail, this method of rendering can lead to significant performance increases in wide field of view displays such as VR headsets. This paper looks at how the techniques used to achieve foveated rendering have developed overtime and what the future of this technology is likely to hold.
