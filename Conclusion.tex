\section{Conclusion}
Since the 1990's foveated rendering has been pointed to as an area of great potential when it comes to reducing the computational cost of rendering. All the example's that have been shown in this paper all focused on tracking the user's gaze and using that information to dramatically reduce computational cost. The paper reveals that over a period of 26 years foveated rendering techniques have been continually developed and improved to the point where soon it will be applicable in modern VR headsets. There is still much that can be done to further develop upon current system's but the development's since the paper by \cite{Levoy} and the paper by \cite{Patney} have been enough for the industry to comfortably make a push for this technology to be released.
